             The power of data to manage projects and make <span class="dv-content">data-driven decisions</span>
             has been demonstrated over the years since the volume of data flows increased significantly in the early 2000s.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">Therefore, every organisation, regardless of its size, <span class="dv-content">must have a data governance policy for its employees</span> and be in the best 
            possible position to face the challenges of the future.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">On this page, you will learn the key concepts of data governance which will help you to get a real understanding of it.</p>
        
        <p class="about-subtitle mt-2">Introduction to Data Governance</p>

        <p class="about-text mt-2">First, let’s see what Data Governance means:</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">Data Governance is a <span class="dv-content">process designed to develop and manage the way data is used and controlled in enterprise systems</span>. It is based on internal standards and policies created by a wide range of employees.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">An effective data governance framework ensures for the companies, data integrity, security and compliance with regulatory requirements. It also helps employees to have a <span class="dv-content">common vision of data use across all IT systems and business departments.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">The ultimate gain for organisations that adopt data governance is the improvement of the decision-making process based on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) based on qualified data collection.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">There are a set of principles that are essential for any organisation wishing to build its data governance.</p>

        <p class="about-subtitle mt-2">Core principles of Data Governance</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">One of the most established principles of data governance is <span class="dv-content">data ownership</span>. It refers to the possession of the responsibility and the acountability of the information. Meaning the power to access, create, update or delete the information. He also has the ability to grant and deny privileges to that information.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">This is why it is an absolute necessity to specify the person with the ownership of each dataset and associated information when developing the data governance strategy.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">Another  conventional rule is <span class="dv-content">transparency</span>. Unavoidable to build trust between employees by improving collaboration and to make stakeholders feel more confident. Also, a well-documented process help to minimise risks such as errors, fraud or risk of non-compliance.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">In this context, <span class="dv-content">the Data Steward plays a key part in controlling the accuracy of data</span> and overseeing the guidelines are well followed by IT and businesses teams.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">As you might expect, data integrity and security are extremely important. Not only to meet regulatory standards, but also because breaches or leaks can have a lasting public impact on organisations. Customers may lose confidence in you if you fail to protect their information.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">Data governance policies include a full part to the technical tools used to manage data flows. This means using <span class="dv-content">common softwares and development stacks</span>. Imagine for a moment that you work in the marketing department of your company, and you have to collaborate with another department that uses a total different software than yours to analyse the latest customer trends. It would be a total mess isn’t it?</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">To avoid this scenario, <span class="dv-content">each department need to be aligned concerning the tools and software used to manage the data flows</span>. A group of people can't decide for themselves which tools to pick. They have to follow the guidelines set by the company.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">Another best practice is <span class="dv-content">to create KPIs to monitor the data flows</span>. The goal is to review how data is processed within the organisation and then provide recommendations to evolve the data governance framework and adapt to new trends.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">In doing so, it will be easier for employees to master the strategy, adhere to compliance requirements, and efficiently manage data quality and security aspects within their daily operations. <span class="dv-content">The continuous improvement is very useful for adapting strategies to new technological needs and initiate data innovation</span></p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">By following these principles, organizations can establish a strong data governance framework that enhances efficiency, security, and compliance.</p>

        <p class="about-subtitle mt-2">Overcoming Data Governance Challenges</p>

        <p class="about-text mt-2">As with all projects, running a data governance strategy can be quite challenging in certains situations. The most impactful is the lack of executive buy-in, where you don't get proven interest from senior management and struggle to gain human and budgetary resources. 
            To overcome this, it's important to align with business targets by building a strong business case that highlights the benefits of data governance.</p>        
            <p class="about-text mt-2">In addition, providing regular reports with accurate metrics is generally appreciated by leadership, as is the success of small initiatives that demonstrate the value of data.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">Another risk is the implementation of data silos that are not connected to each other, making data analysis more complex than ever and resulting in inaccurate reports. Therefore, consistent guidelines are important to have. The solution is to <span class="dv-content"> create a data culture</span> to educate employees, convince them on the importance of standardising data for better outcomes.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">Adopting an <span class="dv-content">agile approach can also help organisations to deliver</span> <span class="dv-content">quick results while continuously improving governance processes with quick wins</span>.</p>

        <p class="about-text mt-2">The rise of AI solutions, particularly in the form of generative AI, is pushing companies to find new ways to respond to their customers. From a technical point of view, AI models are trained using data. Therefore, in order to have powerful AI tools. Data governance must be established to ensure the quality and reusability of the data sets used by AI models.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">Otherwise, the performance of AI tools would not be as high as expected.
