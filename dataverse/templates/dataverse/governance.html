        <p class="about-subtitle mt-2">Introduction to Data Governance</p>

        <p class="about-text mt-2">First, let’s see what Data Governance means:</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">Data governance is a <span class="dv-content">process designed to develop and manage the way data is used and controlled in enterprise systems</span>. It is based on internal standards and policies created by a wide range of employees.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">An effective data governance framework ensure for the companies, data integrity, security and compliance with regulatory requirements. It also helps employees describe a <span class="dv-content">common vision of data use across all IT systems and departments.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">Therefore, the ultimate gain for organisations that adopt data governance is the improvement of the business decision-making process based on key performance indicators (KPIs) that its based qualified data collection.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">The concept of data governance follows several principles that are essential for any organisation wishing to build its data governance.</p>

        <p class="about-subtitle mt-2">The core principles of Data Governance</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">One of most etablished principles of data governance is <span class="dv-content">data ownership</span>. It refers to the possession of the responsability of the information. The owner have the power to access, create, update or delete the information. Furthermore, he has the ability to grant and deny privileges to that information. Finally, the data owner has the accountability of the information.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">This is why it is absolutely essential to decide on the ownership of each dataset and piece of information when developing the data governance strategy.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">Another core principe is <span class="dv-content">transparency</span>. This is the best way to build trust between employees by improving collaboration and to make stakeholders feel more confident in deciding the next steps. Also, well-documented process, policies and well-documented data help to minimise risks such as errors, fraud and non-compliance.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">In this context, <span class="dv-content">the Data Steward plays of key part in controling the accuracy of data</span> and overseeing the guidelines are followed by IT and businesses teams.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">From a data perspective, as you might expect, data integrity and security are extremely important. This is not only to comply with legal standards, but also because data breaches or leaks can have a lasting impact on organisations from a public point of view. Customers may lose confidence in you if you fail to protect their information despite the services you provide.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">Data governance policies include a full part to the technical tools used to manage data flows. This means using <span class="dv-content">common softwares and development stacks</span>. Imagine for a moment that you work in the marketing department of your company, and you have to collaborate with another department that uses a total different software than yours to analyse the latest customer trends. It would be a total mess isn’t it?</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">For this reason, <span class="dv-content">the tools used by the organisation must be the same for all teams</span>. A group of people can't decide for themselves which tools to pick. They must follow the guidelines provided by the company.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">Furthermore, one the best practices in data governance is <span class="dv-content">create KPIs to monitor the data flows</span>. The goal in this practice is to review how data is processed within the organisation and then make recommandations to evolve the data governance framework and adapt to new trends.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">In doing so, it will be easier for employees to understand data governance policies, adhere to compliance requirements, and efficiently manage data quality and security within their daily operations. <span class="dv-content">The continuous improvement is very useful for adapting strategies to new technological needs and create data innovation</span></p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">By following these principles, organizations can establish a strong data governance framework that enhances efficiency, security, and compliance.</p>
