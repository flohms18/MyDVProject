             framework has become an absolute necessity for companies. 
             Indeed, the power of data to manage projects and make <span class="dv-content">data-driven decisions</span>
             has been demonstrated over the years since the volume of data flows increased significantly in the early 2000s.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">Therefore, every company, regardless of its size, <span class="dv-content">have a data governance policy for its employees</span> and be in the best 
            possible position to face the 
            challenges of the future.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">On this page you will learn the key concepts of data governance which will help you to get a real understanding of it.</p>
        
        <p class="about-subtitle mt-2">Introduction to Data Governance</p>

        <p class="about-text mt-2">First, let’s see what Data Governance means:</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">Data Governance is a <span class="dv-content">process designed to develop and manage the way data is used and controlled in enterprise systems</span>. It is based on internal standards and policies created by a wide range of employees.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">An effective data governance framework ensure for the companies, data integrity, security and compliance with regulatory requirements. It also helps employees describe a <span class="dv-content">common vision of data use across all IT systems and departments.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">Therefore, the ultimate gain for organisations that adopt data governance is the improvement of the business decision-making process based on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) based on qualified data collection.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">The concept of data governance follows several principles that are essential for any organisation wishing to build its data governance.</p>

        <p class="about-subtitle mt-2">The core principles of Data Governance</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">One of the most established principles of data governance is <span class="dv-content">data ownership</span>. It refers to the possession of the responsibility of the information. The owner have the power to access, create, update or delete the information. Furthermore, he has the ability to grant and deny privileges to that information. Finally, the data owner has the accountability of the information.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">This is why it is absolutely essential to decide on the ownership of each dataset and piece of information when developing the data governance strategy.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">Another  principle is <span class="dv-content">transparency</span>. This is the best way to build trust between employees by improving collaboration and to make stakeholders feel more confident in deciding the next steps. Also, well-documented process, policies and well-documented data help to minimise risks such as errors, fraud and non-compliance.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">In this context, <span class="dv-content">the Data Steward plays of key part in controlling the accuracy of data</span> and overseeing the guidelines are followed by IT and businesses teams.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">From a data perspective, as you might expect, data integrity and security are extremely important. This is not only to comply with legal standards, but also because data breaches or leaks can have a lasting impact on organisations from a public point of view. Customers may lose confidence in you if you fail to protect their information despite the services you provide.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">Data governance policies include a full part to the technical tools used to manage data flows. This means using <span class="dv-content">common softwares and development stacks</span>. Imagine for a moment that you work in the marketing department of your company, and you have to collaborate with another department that uses a total different software than yours to analyse the latest customer trends. It would be a total mess isn’t it?</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">For this reason, <span class="dv-content">the tools used by the organisation must be the same for all teams</span>. A group of people can't decide for themselves which tools to pick. They have to follow the guidelines set by the company.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">Another data governance best practice is <span class="dv-content">create KPIs to monitor the data flows</span>. The goal in this practice is to review how data is processed within the organisation and then make recommendations to evolve the data governance framework and adapt to new trends.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">In doing so, it will be easier for employees to understand data governance policies, adhere to compliance requirements, and efficiently manage data quality and security within their daily operations. <span class="dv-content">The continuous improvement is very useful for adapting strategies to new technological needs and create data innovation</span></p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">By following these principles, organizations can establish a strong data governance framework that enhances efficiency, security, and compliance.</p>

        <p class="about-subtitle mt-2">Overcoming Data Governance Challenges</p>

        <p class="about-text mt-2">As with all projects, getting a data governance strategy up and running can be quite challenging. The most impactful is the lack of executive buy-in, where you don't get support from senior management and struggle to gain human and budgetary resources. 
            To overcome this, it's important to align with business objectives by building a strong business case that highlights the benefits of data governance.  </p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">In addition, providing regular reports with accurate metrics is always appreciated by leadership, as is the success of small initiatives that demonstrate the value of data.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">Another challenge is the implementation of data silos that are not connected to each other, making data analysis more complex than ever and resulting in inaccurate reports. Therefore, it is important to have <span class="dv-content"> consistent guidelines</span>. The easiest solution is to <span class="dv-content"> create a data culture</span> to educate employees, convince them on the importance of standardising data for better business outcomes.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">A data governance framework is quite challenging to implement due to its complexity, the need for cross-functional collaboration, and the evolving nature of data regulations. However, adopting an <span class="dv-content"> agile approach can help organisations deliver</span> <span class="dv-content">quick results while continuously improving governance processes with quick wins and flexible environments</span>.</p>

        <p class="about-subtitle mt-2">Building a Strong Data Governance Strategy: Key Steps</p>

        <p class="about-text mt-2">There are several steps to developing a data governance strategy for organisations. It can't be built in one go. Depending on the context and size of the organisation, it can take a few months or several years. All an organisation needs is good motivation, patience, openness and agility. <span class="dv-content">Keep in mind that if you take it one step at a time, it will be easier for employees to adapt and be more productive with the new data governance</span>.</p>
            <p class="about-text mt-2">Remember, taking it one step at a time will make it easier for employees to adapt and be more productive with the new data governance.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">The following is a brief overview of the key steps in developing an effective data governance strategy and making data-driven decisions.</p>

        <p class="about-subtitle mt-2">Data Governance is a vital asset for the future </p>

        <p class="about-text mt-2">Customers consistently have new needs, and organizations must adjust accordingly. For the next years and decades, data will become an asset of strategic importance, driving innovation, competitive advantage, and business growth.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">Companies that effectively implement a data governance strategy will be able to anticipate market trends and optimise their internal processes, while ensuring data quality, security and compliance with evolving regulations. For example, the European Union has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which governs how the personal data of individuals in the EU can be processed and transferred.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">In addition, the rise of AI solutions, particularly in the form of generative AI, is pushing companies to find new ways to evolve and respond to their customers. From a technical point of view, AI models are trained using data. Therefore, in order to have powerful AI tools. Data governance must be established to ensure the quality and reusability of the data sets used by AI models.</p>
        <p class="about-text mt-2">Otherwise, the performance of AI tools would not be as high as expected. Organisations that invest in scalable, agile and secure data governance practices will not only adapt to change, <span class="dv-content">they will drive innovation and create new business opportunities in the digital age.</p>
